# usb-hub
A four-port USB 2.0 hub based around the [CoreChips SL2.1A](https://datasheet.lcsc.com/szlcsc/1811151645_CoreChips-SL2-1A_C192893.pdf) IC.

You can choose whether it's bus powered or externally powered with JP1. Soldering JP1 closed selects bus power, while leaving JP1 open means devices are powered with external power, which can be provided through J2.
